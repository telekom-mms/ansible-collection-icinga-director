Synopsis
--------

Get a list of user template objects from Icinga2 through the director API.






Parameters
----------

  query (False, str, )
    Text to filter search results.

    The text is matched on object_name.

    Only objects containing this text will be returned in the resultset.

    Requires Icinga Director 1.8.0+, in earlier versions this parameter is ignored and all objects are returned.


  resolved (optional, bool, False)
    Resolve all inherited object properties and omit templates in output.


  url (True, str, None)
    HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP URL in the form (http|https|ftp)://[user[:pass]]@host.domain[:port]/path


  force (optional, bool, False)
    If ``yes`` do not get a cached copy.


  http_agent (optional, str, ansible-httpget)
    Header to identify as, generally appears in web server logs.


  use_proxy (optional, bool, True)
    If ``no``, it will not use a proxy, even if one is defined in an environment variable on the target hosts.


  validate_certs (optional, bool, True)
    If ``no``, SSL certificates will not be validated.

    This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.


  url_username (optional, str, None)
    The username for use in HTTP basic authentication.

    This parameter can be used without *url_password* for sites that allow empty passwords


  url_password (optional, str, None)
    The password for use in HTTP basic authentication.

    If the *url_username* parameter is not specified, the *url_password* parameter will not be used.


  force_basic_auth (optional, bool, False)
    Credentials specified with *url_username* and *url_password* should be passed in HTTP Header.


  client_cert (optional, path, None)
    PEM formatted certificate chain file to be used for SSL client authentication.

    This file can also include the key as well, and if the key is included, ``client_key`` is not required.


  client_key (optional, path, None)
    PEM formatted file that contains your private key to be used for SSL client authentication.

    If ``client_cert`` contains both the certificate and key, this option is not required.


  use_gssapi (optional, bool, False)
    Use GSSAPI to perform the authentication, typically this is for Kerberos or Kerberos through Negotiate authentication.

    Requires the Python library `gssapi <https://github.com/pythongssapi/python-gssapi>`_ to be installed.

    Credentials for GSSAPI can be specified with *url_username*/*url_password* or with the GSSAPI env var ``KRB5CCNAME`` that specified a custom Kerberos credential cache.

    NTLM authentication is ``not`` supported even if the GSSAPI mech for NTLM has been installed.
