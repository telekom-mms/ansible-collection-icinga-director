Synopsis
--------

Add or remove a servicegroup to Icinga2 through the director API.






Parameters
----------

  state (optional, str, present)
    Apply feature state.


  object_name (True, str, None)
    Name for the Icinga servicegroup.


  display_name (optional, str, None)
    An alternative display name for this group.

    If you wonder how this could be helpful just leave it blank.


  assign_filter (optional, str, None)
    This allows you to configure an assignment filter.

    Please feel free to combine as many nested operators as you want.


  append (optional, bool, None)
    Do not overwrite the whole object but instead append the defined properties.

    Note - Appending to existing vars, imports or any other list/dict is not possible. You have to overwrite the complete list/dict.

    Note - Variables that are set by default will also be applied, even if not set.


  url (True, str, None)
    HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP URL in the form (http|https|ftp)://[user[:pass]]@host.domain[:port]/path


  force (optional, bool, False)
    If ``yes`` do not get a cached copy.

    Alias ``thirsty`` has been deprecated and will be removed in 2.13.


  http_agent (optional, str, ansible-httpget)
    Header to identify as, generally appears in web server logs.


  use_proxy (optional, bool, True)
    If ``no``, it will not use a proxy, even if one is defined in an environment variable on the target hosts.


  validate_certs (optional, bool, True)
    If ``no``, SSL certificates will not be validated.

    This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.


  url_username (optional, str, None)
    The username for use in HTTP basic authentication.

    This parameter can be used without *url_password* for sites that allow empty passwords


  url_password (optional, str, None)
    The password for use in HTTP basic authentication.

    If the *url_username* parameter is not specified, the *url_password* parameter will not be used.


  force_basic_auth (optional, bool, False)
    Credentials specified with *url_username* and *url_password* should be passed in HTTP Header.


  client_cert (optional, path, None)
    PEM formatted certificate chain file to be used for SSL client authentication.

    This file can also include the key as well, and if the key is included, ``client_key`` is not required.


  client_key (optional, path, None)
    PEM formatted file that contains your private key to be used for SSL client authentication.

    If ``client_cert`` contains both the certificate and key, this option is not required.


  use_gssapi (optional, bool, False)
    Use GSSAPI to perform the authentication, typically this is for Kerberos or Kerberos through Negotiate authentication.

    Requires the Python library `gssapi <https://github.com/pythongssapi/python-gssapi>`_ to be installed.

    Credentials for GSSAPI can be specified with *url_username*/*url_password* or with the GSSAPI env var ``KRB5CCNAME`` that specified a custom Kerberos credential cache.

    NTLM authentication is ``not`` supported even if the GSSAPI mech for NTLM has been installed.
